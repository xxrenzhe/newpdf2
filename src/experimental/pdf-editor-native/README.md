# Native PDF Editor (Experimental)

This directory stores an experimental native React PDF editor implementation.

Status:
- Not wired into production routes or `UnifiedToolPage`.
- Kept for future exploration/migration work only.

Primary production editor path remains the iframe-based implementation under:
- `packages/pdfeditor`
- `src/features/pdf-editor`
